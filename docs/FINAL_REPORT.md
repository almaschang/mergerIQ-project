# MergerIQ Intelligent Risk OS — Completion Summary

## Overview
MergerIQ now delivers an end-to-end, explainable intelligence stack that combines evidence tracing, scenario arbitration, compliance simulation, and collaborative action tracking. Each phase layered new analytics and UI capabilities while remaining extendable for persistence and multi-user deployment.

## Phase Deliverables
- **Phase 1 – Evidence Intelligence**: Coherence scoring, contradiction detection, refresh recommendations, and fact-check drawer wired into Evidence Lane.
- **Phase 2 – Scenario Arbitration & Peer Drift**: Multi-model stress arbitration (deterministic + historical + resilience heuristics) with UI panels, plus peer drift analytics integrated into the Compare experience.
- **Phase 3 – Regulatory Simulator & Stakeholder Matrix**: Disclosure sandbox and stakeholder response matrix enriching the risk radar, tied to evidence and drift signals.
- **Phase 4 – Action Marketplace**: In-memory action modules with CRUD/feedback hooks, dashboard marketplace UI, and documentation of persistence/notification next steps.

## Current Architecture Highlights
- Intelligence utilities under `src/utils/intelligence/` provide reusable analytics for evidence, scenarios, compliance, and drift.
- Hooks (`useEvidenceGraph`, `useScenarioCopilot`, `useDisclosureSimulator`, `useActionMarketplace`, etc.) expose data/state for UI components.
- UI surfaces span Evidence Lane, Scenario Copilot, Regulatory Risk Radar, Compare tab, and dashboard marketplace.

## Known Limitations / Opportunities
- Persistence: action modules and analytics now use local storage, but a shared backend store is needed for multi-user collaboration.
- Historical archives: coherence/drift/arbitration history not persisted; enable trend views.
- NLP depth: disclosure simulator relies on keyword heuristics; consider topic modeling/LLM assistance.
- Notifications: no alerting channel for new modules or high-severity risks.
- Rate limits: analytics pull multiple API datasets; caching/backoff strategy advisable before scaling.

## Suggested Roadmap
1. **Backend services** for action modules, historical analytics, and scheduled refresh tasks.
2. **Advanced NLP** for disclosure/stakeholder analysis (topic extraction, contradiction explanation).
3. **Collaboration layer** with notifications, comments, and audit logs.
4. **Stakeholder drift history** with visualization and anomaly detection.
5. **Marketplace analytics** tied to outcomes, enabling automated reinforcement learning for recommendations.

MergerIQ is now positioned as an intelligent market risk OS with explainable AI, compliance automation, and collaborative workflows ready for enterprise hardening.
